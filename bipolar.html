    <h1>Bipolar Disorder</h1>
    <p>Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). These mood shifts can affect a person's energy levels, behavior, and ability to perform daily tasks. It is a chronic and lifelong condition, but with proper management, individuals with bipolar disorder can lead fulfilling lives.</p>

    <h2>Types of Bipolar Disorder</h2>

    <p>There are several types of bipolar disorder, each with distinct patterns of mood swings:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bipolar I Disorder:</strong> This type involves manic episodes lasting at least seven days or severe enough to require hospitalization. Depressive episodes typically last at least two weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Bipolar II Disorder:</strong> This form involves hypomanic episodes (less severe than mania) and depressive episodes. It does not include full-blown manic episodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cyclothymic Disorder:</strong> This type involves chronic mood fluctuations that are less severe than full manic or depressive episodes, lasting for at least two years.</li>
        <li><strong>Other Types:</strong> Some forms of bipolar disorder are linked to medical conditions or substance use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Causes of Bipolar Disorder</h2>

    <p>The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but several factors contribute to its development:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Bipolar disorder tends to run in families. Individuals with a family history of the condition are at a higher risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Biological Differences:</strong> Brain structure and function abnormalities may contribute to bipolar disorder.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Stressful life events, trauma, or substance abuse can trigger or worsen mood episodes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder</h2>
