    <h1>Eating Disorders</h1>
    <p>Eating disorders involve serious disturbances in eating behaviors and related thoughts and emotions. Common types include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. These conditions can cause physical complications and psychological distress.</p>
    <h2>Types of Eating Disorders</h2>
    <h3>1.Anorexia Nervosa</h3>
    <P>Anorexia nervosa is a condition where people avoid food, severely restrict food, or eat very small quantities of only certain foods. They also may weigh themselves repeatedly. Even when dangerously underweight, they may see themselves as overweight.</P>
    <h4>Signs and Symptoms</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Changed body image.</li>
        <li>Low body weight</li>
        <li>Extreme fear of becoming fat.</li>
        <li>Excessive physical activity.</li>
        <li>Denial of hunger</li>
        <li>Fixation with making food.</li>
        <li>Abnormal, obsessive, or ritualized eating behaviors.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2.Bulimia Nervosa</h3>
    <P>Bulimia nervosa is one type of eating disorder in which a person regularly eats excessive amounts of food (binge eats) and then attempts to eliminate (purge) the consequences of overeating by vomiting, taking laxatives or diuretics, fasting or exercising excessively. This is often referred to as “binge and purge.”</P>
    <h4>Signs and Symptoms</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Often a normal or above average body weight.</li>
        <li>Repeated episodes of binge eating and fear of not being able to stop eating.</li>
        <li>Self-induced vomiting (often in secret)</li>
        <li>Excessive exercise.</li>
        <li>Excessive fasting</li>
        <li>Specific eating habits or rituals.</li>
        <li>Misuse of laxatives or diuretics.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3.Binge-eating disorder</h3>
    <p>Binge eating disorder (BED) is a serious mental illness where people eat very large quantities of food without feeling like they’re in control of what they’re doing. It can affect anyone of any age, gender, ethnicity or background, and evidence suggests it is more common than other eating disorders.</p>
    <h4>Signs and Symptoms</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Eat more quickly than usual during binge episodes.</li>
        <li>Eat until you feel uncomfortably full.</li>
        <li>Eat large amounts of food even when you are not hungry.</li>
        <li>Eat alone because you are embarrassed about the amount of food you eat.</li>
        <li>Feel disgusted, depressed, or guilty after overeating</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4. Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder.</h3>
    <P>Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a fairly new eating disorder. Children with ARFID are extremely selective eaters and sometimes have little interest in eating food. They may eat a limited variety of preferred foods, which can lead to poor growth and poor nutrition.</P>
    <h4>Signs and Symptoms</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Severe weight loss.</li>
        <li>Constipation</li>
        <li>Lack of appetite.</li>
        <li>Abnormal menstrual periods.</li>
        <li>Stomach cramps and pain.</li>
        <li>Low iron or thyroid levels.</li>
        <li>Trouble concentrating</li>
        <li>Slow heart rate</li>
    </ul>
