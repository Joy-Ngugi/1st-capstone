    <h2>Causes and Risk Factors of Major Depressive Disorder</h2>

    <p>The exact cause of MDD is complex and involves a combination of biological, psychological, and environmental factors. Common causes and risk factors include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Family history of depression increases the likelihood of developing MDD.</li>
        <li><strong>Brain Chemistry:</strong> Imbalances in neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine can contribute to depressive symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Hormonal Changes:</strong> Hormonal shifts during puberty, pregnancy, menopause, or due to thyroid issues may trigger depression.</li>
        <li><strong>Trauma and Stress:</strong> Emotional trauma, chronic stress, or major life changes can increase the risk of MDD.</li>
        <li><strong>Medical Conditions:</strong> Chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, or chronic pain are linked to higher depression rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Substance Abuse:</strong> Alcohol and drug misuse can worsen or trigger depressive symptoms.</li>
